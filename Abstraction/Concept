                                          Abstraction in java

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided
to the user.
In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.
In java programming, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

*)Java Abstract Classes -:

A java class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is known as abstract class.

1)Java abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body ( public void get(); )

2)But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.

3)If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.

4)To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods
in it.

5)If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.

*)Java Abstract Methods-:

If you want a class to contain a particular method but you want the actual implementation of that method to be
determined by child classes, you can declare the method in the parent class as an abstract.

1)Abstract keyword is used to declare the method as abstract.

2)You have to place the abstract keyword before the method name in the method declaration.

3)An abstract method contains a method signature, but no method body.

4)Instead of curly braces, an abstract method will have a semi colon (;) at the end.

For eg-:
public abstract class Employee {
   private String name;
   private String address;
   private int number;

   public abstract double computePay();
   // Remainder of class definition
}
