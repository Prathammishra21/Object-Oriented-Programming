                                             Access Modifiers

*) Java access modifiers are used to specify the scope of the variables, data members, methods, classes or constructors.
These help to restrict and secure the access of the data.

*) There are four different types of access modifiers in java which are as follows-:

1)Default (No keyword required)
2)Private
3)Public
4)Protected

                                          Default Access Modifier

*) Default access modifier means we do not explicitly declare an access modifier for a class, field, method, etc.

*) A variable method declared without any access control modifier is available to any other class in the same package.
The fields in an interface are implicitly public static final and the methods in an interface are by default public.

For eg-:
            String version = "1.5.1";
            boolean processOrder() {
               return true;
            }

                                          Private Access Modifier

*) Methods, variables and constructors that are declared private can only be accessed within the declared class itself.
Private access modifier is the most restrictive access level. Class and interfaces cannot be private.

*) Variables that are declared private can be accessed outside the class if public getter methods are present int he
class. Using the private modifier is the main way that an object encapsulates its data from outside the world.

                                         Protected Access Modifier

*) Variables, methods and constructors which are declared protected in a superclass can be accessed only by the
subclasses in other packages or any class within the package of the protected members class.

*) The protected access modifier cant be applied to class and interfaces. Methods, fields can be declared protected,
however methods and fields in a interface cant be declared protected.

*) Protected access gives the subclass a chance to use the helper method or variable, while preventing a non-related
class from trying to use it.

                                         Public Access Modifier

*) A class, method, constructor, interface etc. declared public can be accessed from any other class. Fields, methods,
blocks declared inside a public class can be accessed from any class belonging to java universe.

*) However, if the public class we are trying to access which is in different package then the public class still needs
to get imported. Only because of the inheritance, all public methods and variables of a class are inherited by its
subclass.
