Types of polymorphism
1.Compile time polymorphism(Acheived through method overloading)
Same name but types,arguements,return types ,ordering can be different.
eg-multiple constructors
       
        A a = new A();
        A a2 = new A(1,2);

2.Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Polymorphism(Acheived by method overriding)
having same name and same arguements ,return types same as parent class.
           (DYNAMIC METHOD DISPATCH)
    Determines which method to run at runtime which depends on which type of object is created.
